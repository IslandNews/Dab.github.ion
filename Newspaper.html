                <p>In a remarkable revelation, a group of schoolboys, now safely rescued from their nightmarish ordeal, recount the incredible story of their struggle for survival on a remote, deserted island. These exclusive interviews unveil the following series of events: 
                    <br><br>It all began with the catastrophic plane crash, which left them stranded on the island, far from the adults accompanying them. Isolated from the outside world, they faced the daunting task of establishing a society without the guidance of grown-ups. The young survivors shared with us their journey into the wild, where they hunted for food and learned the harsh realities of survival. The signal fire, meant to be their beacon of hope, brought both moments of optimism and deep despair as they grappled to keep it burning. The enigmatic "Beast" became a chilling reality, igniting panic and chaos among the boys as they struggled to comprehend its existence. Leadership disputes emerged among the stranded boys, adding another layer of complexity to their already dire circumstances. A failed signal fire, due to unforeseen challenges, ultimately led to a missed opportunity for rescue, prolonging their isolation on the island. Today, we present their first-hand accounts, shedding light on the challenges they faced and the profound transformations that unfolded during their time on the island.</p>
                    <p>One of the survivors, Jack, recalled the terror of encountering the "Beast" at night, saying, "It was like a nightmare come to life. We all felt it lurking out there, the fear was real, and it changed everything." Ralph, another survivor, added, "Our society fell apart, and we had to fend for ourselves. It was survival of the fittest, and we saw a side of humanity I hope never to see again."</p>
